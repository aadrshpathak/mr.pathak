        <h3>
            CONNECTIVITY </h3>
    <p> 
        "If the connectivity is increased, the Indian north-
eastern states -like Assam and Tripura- can have

access to the seaport in Chattogram," she said.

The Bangladesh premier noted that initiative
were taken to resume cross-border routes
between Bangladesh and India which were
stopped during the 1965 India-Pakistan war,
when Bangladesh was eastern wing of Pakistan.
